# Android_Login
This is an Android Login App using Firebase 

I used Android Studio IDE 

## Installation
Create a Firebase project, register your app with firebase, for more info check this link : https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup 

Firebase will provide you with a downloadable configuration file google-services.json that you need to put in the PROJECT_NAME/app directory 

You will need to modify build.gradle

And run the application
